# Validators

> It is highly recommended that you first read about [_Specs_](specs.md).

Validators are Specs. Yep, its that simple. The main difference is that
validators take in one more argument on their constructor which is an array
mapping strings to strings. This array essentially allows you to override
the messages generated by each constraint.

This means that you can get a SpecResult with user-friendly messages, which can
be useful for generating an API response or flashing validation messages to a
user.

```php
$spec = Validator::define([
        'first_name' => [
            Boa::string(),
            new StringLengthConstraint(1, 60)
        ],
        'last_name' => [
            Boa::string(),
            new StringLengthConstraint(1, 60)
        ],
        'zip' => [
            Boa::integer(),
            Boa::between(10000, 99999)
        ],
        'subscribed' => Boa::boolean(),
    ], [
        'subscribed' => false,
    ], ['first_name', 'last_name', 'phone'], [
        'first_name' => 'Please provide your first name (max 60 chars).',
        'last_name' => 'Please provide your last name (max 60 chars).',
        'zip' => 'Please provide a valid ZIP code.',
    ]);
```
