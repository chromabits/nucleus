# Exceptions

## CoreException

`CoreException` is simply an alias for `Exception`. There are many libraries
out there that include their own exception class, however the class is usually
also named `Exception`, which pollutes auto-completion on IDEs and text editors.

`CoreException` is a slightly more unique name so it shouldn't collide with
other libraries.
